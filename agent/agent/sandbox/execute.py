"""Sandbox executor — turns a validated `Decision` into Bybit Earn actions.

Closes the `.10` decide-only loop:

    snapshot → decide → validate → execute

Scope of `.11` + `.35` + `.47`:
- FlexibleSaving + OnChain subscribe/redeem via `BybitClient.place_earn_order`.
- DualAssets + DiscountBuy via `place_advance_earn_order` (`.35`).
- Liquidity Mining via `add_liquidity` / `remove_liquidity` (`.47`).
- SmartLeverage + DoubleWin remain `SKIP_OUT_OF_SCOPE` — they're
  conditional-payoff structured products without a single annualized
  rate (`.36`).
- Cash venue produces no action (it is residual — whatever isn't
  deployed elsewhere).

Safety:
- `--dry-run` is the default. Live execution requires `--live` explicitly.
- Idempotency keys: `orderLinkId = f"sandbox-{snapshot_ts}-{i:03d}"`. Bybit
  dedupes Earn orders by `orderLinkId` for ~30min, so a repeated dry-run
  → live promotion picks up where it left off without double-subscribing.
- Per-action log line in `executions/<snapshot_ts>.jsonl`: command,
  response, outcome — append-only, easy to grep for post-mortem.

    hedge actions don't book real margin → excluded from the open side.

    `extra_usdt_demand` lets the planner consolidate perp margin and
    non-stable Buy swap demand into a single USDCUSDT conversion. Before
    this, each Buy swap relied on UNIFIED USDT being topped up
    incidentally by the perp-only hedge swap — but the perp consumed
    it before Buy ran, draining UNIFIED and triggering 170131.

    `liquid_usdt_usd` is used (vs the pre-fix `usdt_available_usd`
    UNIFIED-only) because `_ensure_unified_balance` auto-transfers
    FUND→UNIFIED at OPEN_PERP_SHORT and Buy SWAP_SPOT dispatch time, so
    FUND USDT is functionally available for both consumers.

    The swap uses Bybit's `USDCUSDT` spot pair with `side="Sell"` —
    sell USDC (base) for USDT (quote). `qty` is the USDC amount to
    sell, treated 1:1 with the USDT shortfall (stable pair, bps-level
    spread).
